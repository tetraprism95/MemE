# Memer 

Take a picture ONLY if you think it's meme worthy. Post it with a caption to make it even funnier.

## Quick Look (NOTE: BETTER TO USE REAL DEVICE FOR SIGN-UP)

<pre>
If you're too lazy to sign-up and prefer loading with iPhone simulator instead of using a real device 
then I have an existing account just for your convenience.  

Already populated with few posts on the meme feed. 
Obviously, user won't be able to access the camera and take a picture unless one has a real device to take it with.

Note: Created Programmatically
Note: Meme app was created to understand different concepts (concepts will be listed),  

Implementations (LISTED BELOW) 

Imports throughout VC'S : UIKit(Default), Photos, AVFoundation, Firebase 

1. AVFoundation: Camera Implementation displayed in custom UI.

2. Photos: If one wanted to upload photos from Photo Album, this would my idea for photos import.
 
3. Firebase: Learned how to use observe(), updateVal(), Snapshot data to convert to swift, create and update to specific root ref, Fetch data from specific ref. ref = "reference" 

4. Dynamic Cell Sizing: Learned how to create dynamic cell size depending on size of data input. For example, if text is more than 1 line, then the label is able to adjust to that height and will reflect the cell as well.

5. CollectionViewController: Creating UICollectionViewController() && Cell Programmatically. Prefer it over UITableViewController due to flexibility.

6. UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning: Learned how to create custom animation transitions between controllers, .to and .from. Learning the positioning and how to animate using UIView.animate() and ending the completion.

7. UIViewController/ UITextField Login : In welcome/login controller I learned how to adjust the UITextFields positions, x and y, when blocked by keyboard. 

8. NSNotificationCenter to post and observe: When posting a post, another controller will observe the action and handle it accordingly. 

9. Custom Protocol Delegation

10. Completion Callbacks

11. And much more.
